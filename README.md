# Computer-Vision--Make-Model-Year-of-Car

* This is the work I did in my summer intern(2018) at Allai
* I worked on 2 projects
* First, finding the make, model and year of the car from the image
* Second, finding number of doors in the car from the image
* Dataset was scrapped from online sources and it consists of almost 1 million images
